As a software engineer at Lowe's, I have the opportunity to work on innovative solutions that help customers improve their home improvement experiences. I started as an intern in the summer of 2020 and 2021, and then transitioned to a full-time role in January 2022 after graduating with a BS in Computer Science from FSU. I've always had a passion for coding, and I feel fortunate to be able to apply my skills in a way that has a direct impact on people's lives.

When I'm not coding, you'll often find me hiking or sailing. There's something about being in nature that allows me to disconnect from technology and recharge my batteries. Whether I'm exploring local trails or venturing to new destinations, I love the challenge and sense of accomplishment that comes with reaching the summit of a mountain or completing a challenging hike. Similarly, when I'm out on the water, I'm able to fully immerse myself in the present moment and enjoy the tranquility of the open sea. These hobbies give me the balance I need to stay focused and energized in my work.
